# Mathcing Pennies Game

This markdown contains the code for the simulation two different strategies of the matching pennies game. The game is a simple two-player game where each player has to choose between two options (right or left). The winner is determined by whether the choices match or not.

# Strategy 1: Random Choice
```{r}

# function that simulates a single round of the MP game with memory-based strategy
# remembers 

matching_pennies_memory <- function(trials, prob_A_heads) {
  # number of trials 
  num_trials <- length(trials)
  
  # Check if there are enough trials to calculate weighted mean
  if (num_trials >= 7) {
    last_7_trials <- trials[max(1, num_trials - 6):num_trials]
    
    # Calculate weighted mean of outcomes
    weighted_mean <- sum((1:7) * last_7_trials) / sum(1:7)
    
    # Decision based on weighted mean
    outcome_A <- ifelse(weighted_mean > 0.5, "heads", "tails")
  } else {
    # If there are not enough trials, make a random decision
    outcome_A <- ifelse(runif(1) < prob_A_heads, "heads", "tails")
  }
  
  # Player B's decision (random)
  outcome_B <- ifelse(runif(1) < 0.5, "heads", "tails")
  
  # Determine the winner
  if (outcome_A == outcome_B) {
    winner <- "A"
  } else {
    winner <- "B"
  }
  
  return(list(outcome_A = outcome_A, winner = winner))
}


```

```{r}
# function to simulate multiple rounds of the MP game with memory-based strategy
simulate_matching_pennies_memory <- function(num_rounds, prob_A_heads) {
  wins_A <- 0
  wins_B <- 0
  trials <- numeric(0)
  
  for (i in 1:num_rounds) {
    result <- matching_pennies_memory(trials, prob_A_heads)
    if (result$winner == "A") {
      wins_A <- wins_A + 1
    } else {
      wins_B <- wins_B + 1
    }
    # Store outcome of current round
    if (result$outcome_A == "heads") {
      trials <- c(trials, 1)
    } else {
      trials <- c(trials, 0)
    }
  }
  
  return(list(wins_A = wins_A, wins_B = wins_B))
}

```


```{r}
# Example: Simulate 1000 rounds with memory-based strategy where the player considers the last 7 trials
result_memory <- simulate_matching_pennies_memory(1000, 0.5)
cat("Player A wins:", result_memory$wins_A, "\n")
cat("Player B wins:", result_memory$wins_B, "\n")
```
